# Contact Flow Automation Using Terraform

This guide walks you through automating the creation of contact flows in AWS Connect using Terraform. Follow the steps below to set up, configure, and dynamically replace ARNs in your contact flow JSON files.

## 1. Terraform Setup for Contact Flows

To create a contact flow using Terraform, define the following resource in your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
resource "aws_connect_contact_flow" "connect_flow" {
  instance_id  = "<Instance ID>"
  name         = "<Contact Flow name>"
  description  = "<Contact Flow description>"
  type         = "<Contact Flow type>"
  filename     = "<Contact Flow JSON file location>"
  content_hash = filebase64sha256(var.filename)
}
```

#### Contact Flow JSON File

You need to create the contact flow using the AWS Console and export it. The exported JSON file will be used in the Terraform configuration which would be placed inside the "export" folder.

## 2. Dynamic ARN Replacement in JSON

To enable contact flow reusability across environments and AWS accounts, avoid hardcoding ARNs for resources like Lambda functions or prompts. Instead, follow these steps:

- While creating the contact flow in the AWS Console, set parameters using variables (e.g., ${var.lambda_lookup_arn}) instead of hardcoded ARNs.
- After exporting the contact flow JSON, you will see the variables (e.g., ${var.lambda_lookup_arn}) in place of ARNs.

### 2.1 ARN Replacement with Shell Script:

Use the replace_arns.sh script to dynamically replace ARNs in the exported JSON files.

In this case, ARNs must be a variable defined in tfvars file or Terraform configuration.

#### Option 1: Using Terraform with Null Resource

We can use Terraform's null_resource to trigger the ARN replacement script during every execution phase. Here's an example:

```bash
resource "null_resource" "replace_arn" {
  triggers = {
    always_run = "${timestamp()}"
  }
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<-EOT
      ./replace_arns.sh ./exported_flows/contact_flow.json "var.lambda_lookup_arn=${var.lookup_lambda_arn}"
      ./replace_arns.sh ./exported_flows/contact_flow_2.json "var.lambda_lookup_arn=${var.lookup_lambda_arn}" "var.testing=${var.testing_arn}"
    EOT
  }
}
```

This will ensure the ARN replacement script is run before the contact flows are created. Ensure that depends_on is set to execute this resource before the aws_connect_contact_flow resources.

After running the script, the modified JSON with replaced ARNs will be created inside the "current" folder.

#### Option 2: Running the Script Locally or in a CI/CD Pipeline

If we prefer to run the script manually or within a CI/CD pipeline, use the replace_arns_local.sh script. This version is designed to run outside of Terraform.

```bash
./replace_arns_local.sh ./exported_flows/contact_flow.json 'var.beep=${var.beep_arn}'
```

Note: When running the script locally, ensure you use single quotes ' ' instead of double quotes " ". Also, ensure that the beep_arn variable is defined in the tfvars file.

Ensure that the vars.tfvars file contains the variables needed for ARN replacement. If tfvars file has a different name, update the script to point to the correct file:

```bash
tfvars_file="./vars.tfvars"
```
